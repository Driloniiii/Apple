      <p class="aboutparagraf">Learn about the key criteria used to determine whether your Apple Card application is
        approved or declined.<br>

        Goldman Sachs1 uses your credit score, your credit report (including your current debt obligations), and the
        income you report on your application when reviewing your Apple Card application.<br>
        This article highlights a number of factors that Goldman Sachs uses, in combination, to make credit decisions
        but doesn't include all of the details, factors, scores or other information used to make those decisions.<br>

        If you apply for Apple Card and your application is approved, there's no impact to your credit score until you
        accept your offer. If you accept your offer, a hard inquiry is made. This may impact your credit score.<br>
        If your application is declined or you reject your offer, your credit score isn't impacted by the soft inquiry
        associated with your application.<br>

        If your application was declined, learn what you can do to try and improve your next application.<br>

        If you're combining accounts for Apple Card Family, some of the credit factors mentioned above may be considered
        for both co-owners when evaluating a combined credit limit for a co-owned Apple Card.2<br>

        Personal finance companies, like Credit Karma, might display various credit scores, like TransUnion
        VantageScore. While these scores can be informative, if they're not the FICO score that's used for your Apple
        Card application, they may not be <br>
        as predictive of your approval.<br>

        You can also contact Apple Support if you have questions about applying for Apple Card.<br></p>

      <h3 class="aboutparagraf">Requirements to get Apple Card</h3>
      <p class="aboutparagraf">To get Apple Card, you must meet these requirements:<br>

        Be 18 years or older, depending on where you live.<br>
        Be a U.S. citizen or a lawful U.S. resident with a U.S. residential address that isn't a P.O. Box. You can also
        use a military address.<br>
        Use two-factor authentication with your Apple ID.<br>
        Sign in to iCloud with your Apple ID.3<br>
        If you have a freeze on your credit report, you need to temporarily lift the freeze before you apply for Apple

        When assessing your ability to pay back debt, Goldman Sachs1 looks at multiple conditions before making a
        decision on your Apple Card application.<br>

        If any of the following conditions apply, Goldman Sachs might not be able to approve your Apple Card
        application.<br><br>

        <b>If you're behind on debt obligations or have previously been behind</b><br>

        You are currently past due or have recently been past due on a debt obligation.<br>
        Your checking account was closed by a bank (for example, due to repeatedly spending more than your available
        account balance).<br>
        You have two or more non-medical debt collections that are recently past due.<br><br>

        <b>If you have negative public records</b><br>

        A tax lien was placed on your assets (for example, due to a failure to pay sufficient taxes on time).<br>
        A judgement was passed against you (for example, as a result of litigation).<br>
        You have had a recent bankruptcy.<br>
        Your property has been recently repossessed.<br><br>

        <b>If you're heavily in debt or your income is insufficient to make debt payments</b><br>

        You don't have sufficient disposable income after you pay existing debt obligations.<br>
        Your debt obligations represent a high percentage of your monthly income (for example, your unsecured debt
        obligations, such as loans that aren't backed by collateral, are 50% or more of your total income).<br>
        You have fully utilized all of your credit card lines in the last three months and have recently opened a
        significant amount of new credit accounts.<br>
        If you frequently apply for credit cards or loans<br>

        You have a high number of recent applications for credit.<br>
        If your credit score is low

        Goldman Sachs uses TransUnion and other credit bureaus to evaluate your Apple Card application. If your credit
        score is low (for example, if your FICO9 score is lower than 600),5 Goldman Sachs might not be able to approve
        your Apple Card application.<br>

        <h3 class="aboutparagraf9">Apple Inc.</h3>
        <p class="aboutparagraf9">Apple Inc. is an American multinational technology company specializing in consumer
          electronics, software and online services headquartered in Cupertino, California, United States. Apple is the
          largest technology<br>company by revenue (totaling US$365.8 billion in 2021) and, as of June 2022, is the
          world's biggest company by market capitalization, the fourth-largest personal computer vendor by unit sales
          and second-largest mobile phone manufacturer. It is <br>one of the Big Five American information technology
          companies, alongside Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft.<br>

          Apple was founded as Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne to
          develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. It was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple
          Computer, Inc. in 1977 and the company's next computer, the Apple II, became a best seller and one of the
          first mass-produced microcomputers. <br>
          Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial success.<br>
          The company developed computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, including the 1984 original
          Macintosh, announced that year in a critically acclaimed advertisement.<br>
          By 1985, the high cost of its products and power struggles between executives caused problems. <br>
          Wozniak stepped back from Apple amicably and pursued other ventures, while Jobs resigned bitterly and founded
          NeXT, taking some Apple employees with him.<br>

          As the market for personal computers expanded and evolved throughout the 1990s, Apple lost considerable market
          share to the lower-priced duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel-powered PC clones (also
          known as "Wintel"). <br>
          In 1997, weeks away from bankruptcy, the company bought NeXT to resolve Apple's unsuccessful operating system
          strategy and entice Jobs back to the company. <br>
          Over the next decade, Jobs guided Apple back to profitability through a number of tactics including
          introducing the iMac, iPod, iPhone and iPad to critical acclaim, launching "Think different" and other
          memorable advertising campaigns, opening the Apple Store retail chain, and acquiring numerous companies to
          broaden the company's product portfolio.<br>
          When Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two months later, he was succeeded as CEO by Tim
          Cook.<br>

          Apple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion in August 2018, then $2
          trillion in August 2020, and most recently $3 trillion in January 2022.<br>
          The company receives criticism regarding the labor practices of its contractors, its environmental practices,
          and its business ethics, including anti-competitive practices and materials sourcing.<br>
          Nevertheless, the company has a large following and enjoys a high level of brand loyalty. It is ranked as one
          of the world's most valuable brands.<br></p>

          <h3 id="scrollsteve" class="stevetitle">Steve Jobs</h3>
          <p class="stevetitle">Steven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011) <br>
            was an American entrepreneur, <br>
            industrial designer, business magnate, media proprietor, and investor. He was the <br>
            co-founder, chairman,<br>
            and CEO of Apple; the chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar; a member of The Walt <br>
            Disney Company's<br>
            board of directors following its acquisition of Pixar; and the founder, chairman, and <br>
            CEO of NeXT.<br>
            He is widely recognized as a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s <br>
            and 1980s,<br>
            along with his early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.<br>

            Jobs was born in San Francisco to a Syrian father and German-American mother. He was <br>
            adopted shortly after his birth.<br>
            Jobs attended Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he <br>
            traveled through India<br>
            seeking enlightenment and studying Zen Buddhism. He and Wozniak co-founded Apple <br>
            in 1976 to sell Wozniak's <br>
            Apple I personal computer. Together the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with <br>
            production and sale of <br>
            the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. Jobs <br>
            saw the commercial<br>
            potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user <br>
            interface (GUI). <br>
